My name is Ishan.
- ðŸ”­ I've been a Ruby/Go developer for about 7 years and I have a strong background in DevOps using AWS, Kubernetes, RDS, CodeBuild, CircleCI, Docker, etc. I geek out about PostgreSQL, Distributed Systems, Observability and Networking (Cloudflare is a beauty). Recently, I also helped [Chartmogul](https://github.com/chartmogul) move their entire infrastructure from DigitalOcean to AWS while containerising their services and orchestrating them with K8s and migrating multiple instances of different postgres versions from self-managed to RDS. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about use of Transformers in NLP and building custom domain solutions using Cloudflare for SaaS. I also spend time writing Ruby/Go at my day job. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I say that I don't like JavaScript, but I'm always looking out for the next (pun intended) rendering technique or new Web APIs like `View Transitions API`
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building SaaS apps.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Migrating services and databases from one cloud provider to another and Kubernetes!
